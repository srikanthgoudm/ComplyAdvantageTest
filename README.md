ComplyAdvantage Politician Data Application
===========================================
## Tools Used:
* Programming Language: JAVA
* Maven -  Java Project Management Tool (We can run our tests with maven commands)
           And Helps to maintain the dependencies and inter dependencies for the project
           We can find all the dependenciess at https://mvnrepository.com   
* Cucumber-JVM - is a pure Java implementation of Cucumber that supports the [most popular programming languages](https://cukes.info/docs/reference/jvm#running) for the JVM.
                You can [run](https://cukes.info/docs/reference/jvm#running) it with the tool of your choice.

    * Mac: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/install/mac_jdk.html
2. Maven Installations: Download Maven from https://maven.apache.org/install.html and configure in the system
    please run `mvn --version` from command line to see mvn
3. Selenium WebDriver (we can add dependecies to POM.XML file)
4. Cucumber JVM (we can add dependecies to POM.XML file)
5. WebDriver Manager (to setup the browser)
6. Run The Tests from command line:
   Unzip the project folder
   Open command line bash, go to the project folder where you got pom.xml file and run the below command
   * To run the test runner file to triggers the tests
        `mvn -Dtest=RunCucumberTests test`
   * To run all the scenarios you can use `@smoke` tag as below
        `mvn clean test -Dcucumber.options= "-Dtags =@smoke"`
   * To run specific scenario you can use `@specificTagName` tag as below
        `mvn clean test -Dcucumber.options= "-Dtags =@enterEntity"`

7. Using IDE:
   we can use IntellijIdea or eclipse 
   Download Intellij Idea Community Edition (for FREE) from: https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/
   Make Sure you got below Plugins installed on Intellij Idea:
   Cucumber for java, Maven and JAVA is configured to Intellij Idea
   
8. Run the project Using IDE 
    Make sure JAVA is configured to Intellij Idea and other plugins (Cucumber, Maven)
    Unzip the Project and Open the project folder in IntelliJ Idea IDE
    You can change the tags accordingly in `TestRunner.java` file and Run `TestRunner.java` class

    ```

 10. Assumptions:
   * Assumption for field set message (Assuming that error message will display on top of the form)
   And used below dummy locator  
    @FindBy(css = ".form-error") // WebElement fieldSetMessage;   
 11. Bugs:
    * Politician filed reset back to default name before submitting the form
    * Lot of fields missing the validation messages
    * popup(modal) is displaying default name always as field rest back to default name
    * I am able to submit empty form succesfully, and form is accepted with the placeholder text
    * etc...
 
 12. Test Reports:
   * After running the tests, CucumberReports are created and stored in `target/cucumber-reports/index.html`
     you can see the failure steps and details of failure on the reports, index.html can be opened in the browser
