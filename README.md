   Open command line bash, go to the project folder where you got pom.xml file and run the below command
   if you want to run all the scenarios you can use `@smoke` tag as below
   `mvn clean test -Dcucumber.options= "-Dtags =@saveItem"`
   if you want to run specific scenario you can use `@specificTagName` tag as below
   `mvn clean test -Dcucumber.options= "-Dtags =@specificTagName"`
    or you can run `TestRunner.java` which triggers the tests

7. Using IDE:
   we can use IntellijIdea or eclipse 
   Download Intellij Idea Community Edition (for FREE) from: https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/
